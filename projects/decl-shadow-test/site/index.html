<title>Declarative Shadowroot Test</title>
<my-layout>
<h1>Test page</h1>

<p>
Here I am playing around with an approach for generating (mostly static) pages
via <a href="https://github.com/kgscialdone/facet">Facet Web Components</a> that
nontheless also work without JavaScript.
This is achieved by a middleware in the server that finds all Facet component
definitions in the returned HTML and inserts them as a declarative shadow dom
into the usages.
While doing so, it strips out any <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements, and
inserts transitively used components.
If and when the JavaScript loads, all the declarative shadow doms get replaced
by the Facet component, restoring interactivity.

<p>
To prevent having to include the component definitions into every page, the
server also appends a common HTML file into before processing. This leads to
absolutely awful HTML, that is still parsed correctly.
